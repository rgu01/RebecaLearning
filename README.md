**Paper**: [Guess and then Check_: Safety and Security Guaranteed Construction of Cyber-Physical Systems. Rong Gu, Zahra Moezkarimi, Marjan Sirjani. 2024.](https://www.es.mdu.se/publications/6877-Guess_and_then_Check__Safety_and_Security_Guaranteed_Construction_of_Cyber_Physical_Systems)

**Description**: This code implements the controller synthesis algorithm _Guess and then Check_ based on Rebeca. In the folder _state space_, there are several state space files of the example of robots in the paper. The code parses a state space file and explores the state space again by using the _Guess and then Check_ algorithm and synthesizes a safe and secure controller for the robots.
